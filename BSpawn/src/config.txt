teleport_message or teleport_other_message is displayed to the teleporting
player when spawn command is used and a spawn exists. Color codes may be
used by using the '&' (amperstand) symbol in the place of the section symbol
as defined at http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes.

In addition to color codes, teleport_other_message will also resolve macros:
  &x - color codes where x is the color number
  @p - player's name
  @s - command user's name

new_join_commands, join_commands and quit_commands are executed on player join
and quit events. It resolves these macros:
  &x - color codes where x is the color number
  @p - joining player's name
  @( - scoreboard team prefix
  @) - scoreboard team suffix
